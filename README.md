# Mandelbrot GLSL Renderer

A renderer for the **Mandelbrot Set**, written mostly in **GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)**.  
This project demonstrates **how the fractal is calculated and visualized directly on the GPU.**

---

## Project Structure

The project includes an additional folder named **`app_build`**, which contains:

- **`main.cpp`** → The C++ source code responsible for creating a window, compiling, and running the GLSL shaders (`app.exe`).  
- **`compile.bat`** → A simple batch script used to compile the C++ project and generate the executable.

This project uses the **MinGW-w64 compiler** to generate the app.exe.
The compile.bat script is configured to compile using `g++` from **MinGW-w64**.
If you modify any of the shader files, simply **close and reopen `app.exe`** to reload the updated shader code automatically.

## What is the Mandelbrot Set?

The **Mandelbrot Set** is a fractal generated by iterating the equation:

$\(Z_{n+1}=Z_{n}^{2}+C\)$

Where:

- $Z$ is a complex number (`Z = real + imaginary × i`)
- `i` being the imaginary unit $\(𝑖^{2}=−1\)$ and imaginary_part the numeric coefficient that multiplies i.
- $C$ is the point on the **complex plane**, corresponding to the current pixel

The Mandelbrot set is formed by all the points $C$ for which the sequence of $Z$ **does not diverge** (does not grow infinitely).

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

To understand what the shader does, let's rewrite the equation using simple variable names:

| Mathematical Name | Meaning | GLSL Variable |
|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| `B` | Real part (x coordinate) | `uv.x` |
| `C` | Imaginary part (y coordinate) | `uv.y` |
| `A` | Complex coordinate `A = B + C*i` | `(uv.x, uv.y)` |
| `Zreal` | Real component of Z | `zreal` |
| `Zimag` | Imaginary component of Z | `zimag` |

---

### Starting Point

We start with:

Z = 0

Then we apply the Mandelbrot equation:

Z = Z² + A

At the beginning (`Z = 0`):

Z = 0 + B + C*i

In code, this is equivalent to:

```
float zreal = uv.x; // B
float zimag = uv.y; // C
```

So:

Z = B + C*i

---

### First Iteration

Now we calculate:

Z = (B + C*i)² + B + C*i

Expanding the square:

(B + C*i)² = B² + B*C*i + B*C*i + C²*i²

(B + C*i)² = B² + 2*B*C*i + C²*(-1)

(B + C*i)² = B² - C² + 2*B*C*i

Substitute back into the equation:

Z = (B² - C² + B) + (2*B*C + C)*i

---

### Separate Real and Imaginary Parts


Zreal = B² - C² + B

Zimag = 2*B*C + C


This is exactly what happens inside the shader each iteration:

```
float nzreal = zreal*zreal - zimag*zimag + uv.x; // new real part
float nzimag = 2*zreal*zimag + uv.y;             // new imaginary part
zreal = nzreal;
zimag = nzimag;
```

The condition for divergence is:

zreal² + zimag² > 4.0

If true, the point **escapes** (colored white).  
Otherwise, it **belongs** (or tends to belong) to the Mandelbrot Set (colored black).
